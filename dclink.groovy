/**
 * Data center link configuration file for the Sample data center.
 *
 * This file is simply just another Groovy script, meaning you can use any programming constructs available in Groovy.
 * Besides standard Groovy code, it uses special, implicitly defined directives to configure data center links.
 *
 * Currently, the sample data center does not have any links with other data centers.
 * The configuration file will be described in a future update of Hax.
